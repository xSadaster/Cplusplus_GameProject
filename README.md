## Controls
Use **q** in map to exit the program.
Use **wasd** to move.

Enemies have a slight chance of spawning in the forest ('A') but mainly do it on the bridges ('H').
Drinking a potion or checking enemy stats doesn't take your "turn".

The goal is to beat the boss in the bottom right corner.
You may need to kill some enemies for a chance to gain extra potions,
or maybe converse with a.. suspicious shopkeeper to gain attack power.
Good luck.
