## Controls
Use **q** in map to exit the program.
Use **wasd** to move.

Enemies have a slight chance of spawning in the forest ('A') ~1% chance 
but mainly do it on the bridges ('H'). ~75%
Drinking a potion or checking enemy stats doesn't take your "turn" in combat.

The goal is to beat the boss in the bottom right corner.
You may need to kill some enemies for a chance to gain extra potions,
or maybe converse with a.. suspicious shopkeeper to gain attack power in exchange for something.
Good luck.
